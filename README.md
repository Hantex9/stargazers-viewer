## üßê Overview <a name = "overview"></a>
This project is developed in React Native with TypeScript using [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo) since it is a simple app with two main screens:
- A first screen used to search a repository with a search bar at the top and a list of repositories found;
- A second screen used to view the list of all users who have added that repository in to their favorites.
 
The use of TypeScript was chosen to make the project more maintainable and comprehensive. Below I will indicate all the libraries used with the relative reasons of usage:

### Libraries
- [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/): A UI library for React & React Native used for the entire app using their in-box components;
- [React Navigation 6](https://reactnavigation.org/): Used for the routing and navigation for the app, for this app is used only a Stack Navigator;
- [React Native Reanimated 2](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated): An Animation API, in the project is used to show animations to improve the UX;
- [Lottie React Native](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native): A library used to render animations natively, in the project it is used to show animations such as the Not Found in a list after a search and in the on boarding page at the startup of the project;
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): A promise-based HTTP Client, used to make HTTP requests (in this case to the GitHub APIs);
- [Moment](https://github.com/moment/moment): A library used for formatting dates;
- [Expo Splash Screen](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/): Used for pre-loading fonts and showing a Splash Screen until they are not loaded correctly;

### Utility Libraries
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Used as code formatter of the project;
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint): A tool that analyzes code to quickly find problems used with the VSCode extension
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest): A testing library used to implements Unit Tests in the app;

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run this application, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Expo CLI](https://expo.dev/tools) installed on your computer

## üì± App builds <a name = "app_builds"></a>
If you don't want install the local environment, I provided in this project also a build for *android* and *ios*, so you can try the app on your simulator or device just installing the apk/ios-build on it.

You can find the final builds in the directory "NOME_DIRECTORY"

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
To run tests there are available two main npm command that you can type in order to check tests.

Use this following command in order to start tests and check if they pass or not
